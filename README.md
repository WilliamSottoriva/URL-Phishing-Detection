# URL-Phishing-Detection

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to the problem of website
phishing detection. Specifically, two models—a Perceptron and a Neural Network (NN)—are
developed and compared to classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate. The project utilises a
dataset containing over 11,000 URLs, with features extracted based on their structure, content,
and external indicators. Key preprocessing steps, such as feature scaling and correlation analysis,
are applied to optimise model input and ensure accuracy.

The study found that the Neural Network outperformed the Perceptron in detecting phishing
URLs, achieving an accuracy of 96.44% compared to the Perceptron’s 91.84%. The Neural
Network's ability to model complex, non-linear relationships between features through a multi-
layer architecture and regularisation techniques contributed to its superior performance.
However, the Perceptron demonstrated faster training times, making it a viable option for
resource-limited environments. Maximising accuracy while minimising overfitting issues was a
major challenge, addressed through hyperparameter optimisation and model architecture choices.

The findings underscore the importance of advanced machine learning models in addressing
cybersecurity challenges, with the potential to significantly reduce the impact of phishing attacks
by accurately identifying malicious websites.
